# RunBlox

This repo is for:

- Reporting of issues found within and when using RunBlox App.
  Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-blox/runblox-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making an issue submission

  > Do not open Github issues for questions or requests. Instead, please direct all such questions and inquiries to our official community channels <https://linktr.ee/RunBlox>.

- Surrounding discussions about the RunBlox App.
- Release announcements & change notes.

## Labels:

Here is your best way to interact directly with the RunBlox teams. We will be monitoring and responding to issues as best we can. Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible. Issues may be tagged with the following labels:

- **bug** – The issue is considered to be a bug internally by the dev team. This tag is generally for gaps in implemented (read: intended to be working) RunBlox App behavior. Things marked with **bug** have a corresponding bug on RunBlox’s internal bug tracking system. Example: "iOS crashes on recovery from background"

- **feature** – Denotes something understood as not working and is not yet implemented. Example: "We need an In-App wallet"

- **duplicate** – The submission is substantially duplicative of an existing issue, and/or has the same underlying cause.

- **need-repro** – The issue submission is missing fields from the issue [template](https://github.com/open-blox/runblox-app/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE), cannot be reproduced with the information provided, or is not actionable.

- **discussion** – Submissions which are not a bug report or feature request. Example: "Disscussion on increasing breeding cooldown"

- **bydesign** – Denotes an issue that is considered working as intended.

- **android** - The issue relates specifically to Android App.

- **ios** - The issue relates specifically to iOS App.

Additional tags may be used to denote specific types of issues.

## Closing:

Issues may be closed by the original poster at any time. We will close issues if:
- The issue is not a bug or feature request
- The issue has been addressed
- The issue is a duplicate of another issue
- Discussions or questions that have run their course
- The issue has been inactive within 30 days period

## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct presents a summary of the shared values and “common sense” thinking in our community. The basic social ingredients that hold our project together include:

-   Be considerate
	> All communications should be respectful. Differences of opinion are okay; personal attacks are not. Comments or content that are violent, threatening, abusive, sexually explicit, obscene, offensive, hateful, derogatory, defamatory, or are racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable content will be removed, accounts will be banned.

-   Be respectful
	> Comments, questions and contributions should be relevant to the topic being discussed. Keep in mind that this is not a place for unsolicited personal or commercial solicitation or advertising (e.g., “Download xxx App”, etc.).

-   Be collaborative
	> In order to avoid misunderstanding, try to be clear and concise when requesting help or giving it. Remember it is easy to misunderstand emails (especially when they are not written in your mother tongue). Ask for clarifications if unsure how something is meant; remember the first rule – assume in the first instance that people mean well.

- Accuracy is important
	> When reporting an issue, it is very important that we could get a clear context when, how and where your issue happend. If the context of your issue is not clear, and the bug is not reproducible, then it will probably never get fixed. Be sure to read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-blox/runblox-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the report template when making an issue submission.

-   No spam
	> No one likes seeing the same message posted all the time. Spamming will get you banned.

- Don’t upload or post inappropriate content
	> If a user uploads inappropriate, pornographic or offensive, or otherwise objectionable content, such user may be banned from the Community.

-   Support others in the Community
	> Other people in the Community may experience the same issue you encountered. If you have found a solution or work around, everyone will be preciated if you share it with the public.

-   Get support from others in the community
	> Likewise, you are usually not lone when you encountered an issue. Please search for existing issues/community support before opening a new issue.
